# Multi-Version Support — Development TODO

**Scope:** Fabric only. Target: **every stable `1.21.x` (12) and every stable `26.x` (4)** = 16
versions. NeoForge/Forge deferred (see bottom).

**Strategy:** branch-per-band (ruling **R-a**). `master` **is** the newest band; `mc/**` exists only
for older bands and is cut by hand. A **band** = a contiguous range of MC versions across which
mcMMO's touched surface is identical, measured by `scripts/probe-bands.py` against a 1386-record
manifest — a lookup, not a judgment call.

> Phases 0–7 are complete and archived at
> [plans/completed/TODO-multiversion-phases-0-7.md](plans/completed/TODO-multiversion-phases-0-7.md).
> Everything below is forward work. The archive is the only place the per-phase findings live in
> full; memory files under `.agent/memory/` carry the gotchas.

## What ships today — 4 branches, **7 of 12** `1.21.x` versions

⚠️ **There is no per-version jar and there never was. One jar covers a band**, via the range in its
own `fabric.mod.json`. Read from each branch (`git show <branch>:src/main/resources/fabric.mod.json`),
not retyped:

| Branch | MC versions covered | `depends.minecraft` | Released tag |
|---|---|---|---|
| `master` | `1.21.11` | `~1.21.11` | `mc1.21.11-v2.2.050-build.26` |
| `mc/1.21.10` | `1.21.9`, `1.21.10` | `>=1.21.9 <1.21.11` | `mc1.21.10-v2.2.050-build.25` |
| `mc/1.21.8` | `1.21.6`, `1.21.7`, `1.21.8` | `>=1.21.6 <1.21.9` | `mc1.21.8-v2.2.050-build.24` |
| `mc/1.21.5` | `1.21.5` | `>=1.21.5 <1.21.6` | `mc1.21.5-v2.2.050-build.27` |

🔑 **So `1.21.6`, `1.21.7` and `1.21.9` are NOT missing** — they are covered by the `mc/1.21.8` and
`mc/1.21.10` jars respectively. Nothing needs building for them.

## What is genuinely missing — **5 `1.21.x` versions + all 4 `26.x`**

| Band | MC versions | Manifest rows (absent · sig-changed) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `1.21.4` | `1.21.4` | 15 · 27 = **42** | ⬜ not cut |
| `1.21.3` | `1.21.2`, `1.21.3` | 16 · 28 = **44** | ⬜ not cut |
| `1.21.1` | `1.21`, `1.21.1` | 65 · 60 = **125** | ⬜ not cut — 🔴 see R-m |
| `26.x` | `26.1`, `26.1.1`, `26.1.2`, `26.2` | n/a — **full yarn→official rename** | ⬜ not cut |

**Four branches to cut.** They were excluded by ruling R-b's `1.21.5` floor, which **R-l now
supersedes** — not by any technical finding except the one at band `1.21.1`.

⚠️⚠️ **Read a row count as *rows to look at*, never as work to do.** The three completed bands are
the calibration, and the table over-predicts by 4–6×:

| Band | Table said | Real code changes |
|---|---|---|
| `mc/1.21.10` | 10 | **1** |
| `mc/1.21.8` | 32 | **6** |
| `mc/1.21.5` | 27 | **~8**, two of them redesigns |

Most signature deltas are benign (a covariant return, an added overload). What the table *cannot*
price is the difference between a **signature change** and an **absence**: `getEntityWorld` cost
`mc/1.21.5` **3** broken sites and `mc/1.21.8` **57**, from the same one row.

## RULINGS

Carried forward and still binding: **R-a** branch-per-band · **R-c/P2-a…e** full platform seal ·
**R-d** playtest stays on master builds · **R-e** `26.x` is its own mini-project · **R-f** master =
newest band · **R-g** `.github/` is master-only · **R-h** pushes are mine once gates are green ·
**R-i/R-j/R-k** docs are byte-identical on every branch, live wiki is never pushed.

| # | Question | Ruling |
|---|---|---|
| **R-l** | Support floor (2026-08-12) | ✅ **RULED (owner, 2026-08-12) — supersedes R-b's `1.21.5` floor.** Floor moves to **`1.21`**; ship all 12 `1.21.x` + all 4 `26.x`. R-b dropped `1.21`–`1.21.4` to dodge the component-API cliff; that cliff is real but it is confined to band `1.21.1`, and `1.21.4`/`1.21.3` were never touched by it. *Was recorded PROPOSED; ruled when the owner directed Phase 8 to start, which exists only under this floor.* |
| **R-m** | Band `1.21.1`'s three absent subsystems | ✅ **RULED (owner, 2026-08-12): capability-probe and disable.** Ship the band with Farmer's/Fisherman's Diet, Unarmored, Agility and Stealth switched off rather than reimplemented. Reimplementing three seams against the 2024 API is larger than the other three bands combined, and 6.4's stop-loss would have justified dropping the versions entirely — this keeps them shipping. |
| **R-n** | Is `.agent/` committed? (2026-08-12) | ✅ **RULED (owner): NO — the gitignore was right, the docs were wrong.** Memory stays local to one working copy; `AGENTS.md` and both `save-memory` skill copies were corrected. ⚠️ `.claude/`, `.github/`, `CLAUDE.md` and `.mcp.json` are ignored too — **`AGENTS.md` is the only tracked agent-facing file in the repo.** Two consequences nothing warns you about: **a fresh clone has no memory and no skills**, and **memory cannot drift between branches because it does not travel with them** — one tree serves every checkout, so entries must name the branch they describe rather than say *"here"*. Anything another checkout needs goes in `TODO.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or the commit message. |

### R-m — what it actually takes (⚠️ the Spears precedent only half-applies)

Band `1.21.1` is not a rename job. Three subsystems are **absent**, not reshaped, and each backs a
shipped player-facing feature:

| Absent on `1.21`/`1.21.1` | Backs |
|---|---|
| `FoodComponent#onConsume`, `ConsumableComponent`, `DataComponentTypes#CONSUMABLE` | **Farmer's Diet + Fisherman's Diet** — the eating seam, whole |
| The entire `EntityAttributes#*` family (8 records: `ARMOR`, `MOVEMENT_SPEED`, `MAX_HEALTH`, `ATTACK_DAMAGE`, `JUMP_STRENGTH`, `SNEAKING_SPEED`, `WATER_MOVEMENT_EFFICIENCY`) | **Unarmored** (`ARMOR` *is* its mechanic), **Agility**, `SkillAttributeService` |
| `PlayerInput` + `ServerPlayerEntity#getPlayerInput` | **Stealth** — its real server-side key-state seam |

Plus `ExplosionImpl`, `AbstractCowEntity`, `AbstractBoatEntity`, `EntityConversionContext` and
`LivingEntity#travelGliding`. This is **exactly the R6 component-API cliff predicted at Phase 1.5**,
landing where 1.5 measured it — at `1.21.2`, so `1.21.2`+ is clear and only this band pays.

It also **trips stop-loss 6.4**: 125 rows against the largest completed band's 32 is **3.9×**, and
the rule says stop and re-scope rather than push through. R-m is that re-scope.

⚠️⚠️ **A probe alone CANNOT implement this, and the difference from Spears is load-bearing.**
`SkillAvailability#probe` works for Spears because the absent things are **registry entries** —
`Items.IRON_SPEAR` is a lookup that misses, so one expression is correct on every band and `master`
never changes. Here the absent things are **types, static fields and mixin targets**, which are
*compile-time* and *classload-time* facts:

| Absence | Fails as | So the band branch must |
|---|---|---|
| `EntityAttributes#ARMOR` and 7 siblings | **compile error** | resolve it in `platform/` (`SkillAttributeService`) — the code cannot merely be gated at runtime |
| `PlayerInput` class + `getPlayerInput()` | **compile error** | same, inside `fabric/`/`platform/` |
| `FoodComponent#onConsume` | **mixin fails to apply → boot failure** | the mixin must be removed or re-seamed on the band, not left present-but-inert |

🔑 That last row is the dangerous one. An unresolvable `@At` target does not degrade gracefully — on
`mc/1.21.5` **two** of them took out `Blocks.<clinit>`, then `Items.<clinit>`, and cascaded into
**302 failing tests across 34 unrelated classes**. Read the root cause, never the count.

**So R-m is two pieces of work, not one:**

1. **On the band branch** — make it compile and boot: resolve the attribute and `PlayerInput`
   absences in `fabric/`/`platform/`, and remove or re-seam the eating-seam mixin.
2. **On `master` first** — a `SkillGating` switch for each affected skill, so all six meanings of
   "disabled" close at once (no XP, no procs, no super ability, no XP bar, no `/mcstats` line, no
   plaques) and `/mcstats <skill>` explains it is the *Minecraft version*, not `coreskills.yml`.
   ⚠️ Per `ConfigRetunes`, **flipping a shipped config default is not sufficient** —
   `copyMissingDefaults` back-fills only absent keys, so a changed default reaches nobody who has
   already run the mod once.

⚠️ **Whatever drives the gate must be provable in BOTH directions on EVERY band.** The first Spears
wiring test was vacuous — it asserted the skill was *enabled* on `master`, which a completely absent
gate satisfies just as well, and the disabling half is unreachable from the branch the code is
written on. Take the inputs as arguments and add a `setForTesting` seam, as `SkillAvailability` now
does. *(Fifth vacuous-guard sighting in this project — assume the sixth is this one.)*

---

## Phase 8 — the three sub-floor `1.21.x` bands

Order is cheapest-first and **each branch is cut from `master`, never from the previous band** —
otherwise band N inherits band N−1's back-compat fixes and the diffs stop being independent. The
*learning* transfers even though the branch does not: `1.21.4`'s absent set is very nearly a subset
of `1.21.3`'s, so the second cut should be fast.

### Per-band recipe (Phase 4′, unchanged)

- [ ] **8.x.1** `git switch -c mc/<band>` off `master`.
- [ ] **8.x.2** First commit pins that band's toolchain in `gradle.properties` **and nothing else**:
      `minecraft_version`, `yarn_mappings`, `loader_version`, `fabric_version`, ModMenu, Cloth.
      ⚠️ **Look the yarn build number up** — it is not derivable from the version
      (`1.21` → `build.9`, `1.21.1` → `build.3`, `1.21.2` → `build.1`, `1.21.3` → `build.2`,
      `1.21.4` → `build.8`).
- [ ] **8.x.3** `fabric.mod.json` `depends.minecraft` = the band's **range**, not its newest version.
- [ ] **8.x.4** ⚠️ **Decide `.github/` deliberately.** A branch cut from `master` today inherits
      **no** `.github/`, because R-g removed it there — so it silently never releases. `mc/1.21.5`
      hit exactly this by accident of cut timing. Either force-add the three files its siblings track
      (`.github/` is in `.gitignore`, so `git add -f`; un-ignoring instead sweeps in 12 files no
      branch tracks) or accept manual release, but make it a choice.
- [ ] **8.x.5** Compile. Work errors against `BAND_TABLE.md`. **Fix inside `fabric/` and `platform/`
      only** — `PlatformBoundaryGuardTest` must stay green. Phase 2's blast-radius cap has now held
      on two real MC API breaks.
- [ ] **8.x.6** 🔑 **Ask first, every band: can `master` absorb the difference instead?** Widening
      `CHEAT_COMMAND` to `java.util.function.Predicate` on `master` cut `mc/1.21.10`'s whole
      main-source diff to one token. It fails when there is no overlapping name on both sides
      (`getEntityWorld`), so ask, don't assume.
- [ ] **8.x.7** Run the full ship gate (below). Then push.
- [ ] **8.x.8** Back-port anything that belongs on `master` **to `master` first**, then to every
      other band with `Backport-of:` trailers.

### The bands

- [ ] **8.1 — `mc/1.21.4`** (`1.21.4` only; 42 rows). The cheapest and the one to prove the loop on,
      because it is the last band `config-id-audit.py` can still audit.
- [ ] **8.2 — `mc/1.21.3`** (`1.21.2`, `1.21.3`; 44 rows). ⚠️ Blocked on **8.4** for a full gate run.
- [ ] **8.3 — `mc/1.21.1`** (`1.21`, `1.21.1`; 125 rows). Per **R-m**, two pieces: the `SkillGating`
      switches land on **`master` first**, then the band branch resolves the compile/mixin absences.
      Blocked on **8.4** for a full gate run. Do this band **last** — it is the only one that changes
      `master`.

### 8.4 — 🔴 BLOCKER: `config-id-audit.py` cannot audit below `1.21.4`

- [ ] Give `config-id-audit.py` a registry-id source that works below `1.21.4`, or the `1.21.3` and
      `1.21.1` bands ship with **one of the seven gates missing**.

`assets/minecraft/items/` was added in `1.21.4`; below that the script **refuses to report rather
than calling every item absent** (`config-id-audit.py:310`) — correct behaviour, and it means 689 id
references across six config files go unchecked on two of the three new bands. That gate is what
found three live XP holes on `master` that no compiler, test or boot log could see.

⚠️⚠️ **Both obvious replacements are already ruled wrong and neither fails visibly:** `javap Blocks`
yields **yarn field names, not registry ids** (and `CopperBlockSet` hides several ids behind one
field), and `lang/en_us.json` **keeps stale keys through renames** — `1.21.11` still carries
`block.minecraft.chain`, so the exact bug the audit found reads as clean there. Find a third source
(the data generator's `reports/registries.json` is the candidate) and **prove it against a version
where the current source also works**, so the two can be compared before the old one is left behind.
`--self-test` and the 95% control floor must both still pass.

---

## Phase 9 — the `26.x` band

**Its own mini-project (R-e). Do not absorb it into a sweep.** Gated behind Phase 8 delivering at
least one completed ordinary band, so the loop is known to work before the hard band starts.

From `26.1` Minecraft **ships unobfuscated** — verified against the real artifact (`26.2` server
jar: 7,434 `net/minecraft/*` classes, zero obfuscated names). Mappings are absent because they are
no longer *needed*, not because tooling is missing.

**But Mojang names are not yarn names, and the schemes differ structurally:**

| | official (`26.x`) | yarn (what this mod is written in) |
|---|---|---|
| item stack | `net.minecraft.world.item.ItemStack` | `net.minecraft.item.ItemStack` |
| server player | `net.minecraft.server.level.ServerPlayer` | `net.minecraft.server.network.ServerPlayerEntity` |
| food | `net.minecraft.world.food.FoodProperties` | `net.minecraft.component.type.FoodComponent` |

So this band is a **wholesale rename of the entire MC-facing surface**: ~164 imports, 42 mixins, 44
method selectors, 19 `@At` descriptors, plus every MC type named in a method body.

🔑🔑 **This is what vindicated R-a.** No preprocessor directive can bridge an identifier rename of
this size; a branch is the only honest representation.

- [ ] **9.1 Derive the yarn→official translation table.** Yarn's `v2` mappings carry
      `official → intermediary → named` columns, so the table can be **derived** for `1.21.11` and
      largely reused rather than hand-written. **Confirm this before budgeting the rename as manual** —
      it is the difference between a script and a month.
- [ ] **9.2 Toolchain.** `26.x` needs a newer Loom than our **1.17.13**, and `build.gradle:30` pins
      `net.fabricmc:yarn:${yarn_mappings}:v2`, which 404s for every `26.x`. ⚠️ **Confirm exact plugin
      coordinates at the time of the attempt — do not pin from this note, it will be stale.** As of
      2026-08-10: stable `1.17.19`, active track `1.18.0-alpha.*` (moves daily).
- [ ] **9.3 Translate the tooling, not just the source.** `scripts/mc-surface.txt` is yarn-named and
      **does not apply to this band**, so `probe-bands.py` cannot probe it at all until 9.1 lands.
      `mixin-allow-audit.py` and `extract-mc-surface.py` read the same names. **The band cannot run
      its own gates until its tooling speaks official names.**
- [ ] **9.4** Cut `mc/26.x` per the 8.x recipe; `depends.minecraft` covers `26.1`–`26.2`.
- [ ] **9.5** Full ship gate. Expect `boot-check.sh` and `gameplay-smoke.sh` to need version-specific
      fixture work (Carpet build, command syntax).

⚠️ `26.1 > 1.21.11` sorts correctly under semver, so version *predicates* need no special-casing.
The obstacle was never the version string.

---

## Phase 10 — jar naming and release versioning (owner-requested 2026-08-13)

**The ask:** the uploaded jar should name the Minecraft versions it supports, and the mod version
should mean something. Target host is **CurseForge**, which attaches **one file to many game
versions** — so this is a *labelling* change, not a build-matrix change. Ruled with the owner:
one jar per band, range-named, `+mc<lo>-<hi>`, and the run-number suffix **dropped**.

### 10.0 — the three defects, named separately

They are not one problem and they do not have one fix:

1. **The jar filename carries no Minecraft version at all.** `mcmmo-2.2.050-build.28.jar`. The MC
   version exists only in the git tag and inside `fabric.mod.json`. This is the manual-rename tax.
2. **`build.<N>` is `GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER`, which is repo-global, not per-branch.** The five branches
   sit at `build.28` / `.27` / `.24` / `.25` / `.26` for **identical mod code**. Five numbers that
   read like five versions and are not comparable in any direction. This is the "no coherent
   versioning" complaint, and it is the load-bearing one.
3. **`2.2.050` is not the version the mod reports.** Fabric's semver parser normalises the padded
   patch — `Version.parse("2.2.050").getFriendlyString()` → **`2.2.50`** (measured against
   `fabric-loader-0.19.3`, 2026-08-13). So the filename would say `2.2.050+mc1.21.4` while ModMenu
   says `2.2.50+mc1.21.4`. Already true today (`2.2.050-build.28` displays as `2.2.50-build.28`).
   ⚠️ **Left as-is pending an owner ruling** — `2.2.050` mirrors upstream mcMMO's padded scheme, and
   silently re-identifying the mod is not in scope for a naming task. See 10.6.

### 10.1 — the scheme

| Band | `supported_minecraft_versions` | Jar |
|---|---|---|
| `master` | `1.21.11` | `mcmmo-2.2.050+mc1.21.11.jar` |
| `mc/1.21.10` | `1.21.9,1.21.10` | `mcmmo-2.2.050+mc1.21.9-1.21.10.jar` |
| `mc/1.21.8` | `1.21.6,1.21.7,1.21.8` | `mcmmo-2.2.050+mc1.21.6-1.21.8.jar` |
| `mc/1.21.5` | `1.21.5` | `mcmmo-2.2.050+mc1.21.5.jar` |
| `mc/1.21.4` | `1.21.4` | `mcmmo-2.2.050+mc1.21.4.jar` |

Single-version band → bare `+mc<ver>`. Multi-version band → `+mc<lo>-<hi>`. Local dev builds keep
`-SNAPSHOT`, which lands *before* the `+`: `2.2.050-SNAPSHOT+mc1.21.4` (correct semver ordering —
pre-release, then build metadata).

✅ **All five strings verified loader-parseable** against `fabric-loader-0.19.3` before this plan was
written, including the range and `-SNAPSHOT` forms. Not assumed — run and read.

### 10.2 — `master` first (gradle side)

- [ ] **10.2a** Add `supported_minecraft_versions=<csv>` to `gradle.properties`, next to
      `minecraft_version`, with a comment saying it is the **band's** coverage and that
      `fabric.mod.json`'s `depends.minecraft` is the other half of the same fact.
- [ ] **10.2b** `build.gradle`: derive the `+mc…` label from that property and append it to
      `version`. ⚠️ Resolve at **configuration** time — `processResources` already carries the
      configuration-cache scar (dereferencing `project` in an execution-time closure is rejected);
      the same rule binds here.
- [ ] **10.2c** New guard `src/test/java/com/gmail/nossr50/guards/BandVersionLabelTest.java`,
      following `MixinAllowCoverageTest`'s shape (heavy *why* javadoc + explicit converse checks):
      - every version in the property **satisfies** `depends.minecraft`, using Fabric's own
        `VersionPredicate` engine — not a regex over the range string;
      - the list is sorted, contiguous-as-declared, and its endpoints match the predicate's bounds,
        so a range **wider** than the list is caught too (the direction a one-way check misses);
      - the computed label round-trips through `Version.parse` — the check run by hand for 10.1,
        made permanent so a future band cannot ship an unparseable version;
      - **converse:** a deliberately-wrong list must make the detector fire. A guard that has never
        failed is not known to work.
      ⚠️ Must **not** live in `com.gmail.nossr50.fabric.mixin` — that package is claimed by the Mixin
      transformer under Knot and a test there fails to *load*, not to assert.
- [ ] **10.2d** README: the band table gains the jar name per band. Caveat-expiry pass — grep the
      **symptom** (`build.`, `mcmmo-2.2.050`), not the files edited.

### 10.3 — the four bands (gradle side)

Cherry-pick 10.2 onto `mc/1.21.10`, `mc/1.21.8`, `mc/1.21.5`, `mc/1.21.4`, each with a
`Backport-of: <master sha>` trailer, each with its **own** `supported_minecraft_versions` — the value
is per-band and must not be copied. Same trap as the generated MC-surface manifest: the *generator*
back-ports, the *value* is re-derived per band.

### 10.4 — 🔴 `release.yml` cannot land on `master` first

**`master` has no `.github/` at all** (ruling R-g). `release.yml` exists **only** on the four band
branches. So the CI half of this work structurally **cannot** obey "fixes land on `master` first" —
there is no file on `master` to fix. This is an R-g consequence, not a shortcut.

- [ ] **10.4a** On each of the four bands, edit `.github/workflows/release.yml`: drop
      `-build.${GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER}` from the computed version, and fix the hard-coded asset paths in
      the *Publish release* step (`build/libs/mcmmo-${…}.jar`) — **those paths break the moment the
      jar is renamed**, and the step `exit 1`s on a missing asset, so this is the one change that
      fails loudly rather than silently.

      ✅ **RULED: the tag keeps its `mc<VER>-v` prefix** and only loses the `-build.<N>` suffix —
      `mc1.21.4-v2.2.050`, not `v2.2.050+mc1.21.4`. Tempting to make the tag match the jar name, but
      the prefix is load-bearing twice over and matching the filename buys nothing a git ref needs:
        - the *"delete previous release on this Minecraft line"* sweep matches `mc<VER>-v*`. Keeping
          the prefix means it still matches the four existing `mc1.21.*-v2.2.050-build.*` releases, so
          they are reaped automatically on the next release. **This retires 10.6.2 entirely** — a new
          tag shape would have orphaned them and left manual cleanup;
        - **R10** (no two branches on one `minecraft_version`) is detected through that same prefix.
      So the jar name and the tag deliberately differ. The jar is what a player reads; the tag is what
      the release automation keys on.
- [ ] **10.4b** State the exception in each commit body (no `master` parent exists, and why).
      ⚠️ `drift-audit.py` walks **`master`** commits looking for `Backport-of:` trailers, so a
      band-only commit is **invisible** to it — no false alarm, and no protection either. Four
      hand-edits with nothing checking they agree.
- [ ] **10.4c** Decide what replaces per-push uniqueness. Dropping the run number means two pushes
      at the same `mod_version` produce the **same** tag. The existing *"delete previous release on
      this Minecraft line"* sweep already keeps exactly one release per line, and `git tag -f`
      already force-moves the tag, so replacement is the current behaviour — but the commit sha in
      the release notes becomes the **only** way to tell two builds of `2.2.050` apart.

### 10.4′ — 🔴 ORDERING: on a band, 10.3 and 10.4 are ONE commit

Landing the gradle rename on a band **without** the `release.yml` fix breaks that band's next
release. `release.yml` builds with `-Pmod_version=…-build.${RUN}` and then looks for the literal path
`build/libs/mcmmo-${RELEASE_VERSION}.jar`. After the rename the jar is
`mcmmo-…-build.${RUN}+mc1.21.4.jar`, the path misses, and the *Publish release* step `exit 1`s —
which trips the cleanup step and deletes the tag it had already pushed.

That failure is **loud and self-cleaning**, not silent, and it is the reason 10.4a is worth doing in
the same commit rather than trusting a follow-up. `master` is exempt: it has no workflow, so 10.2 can
land there alone.

### 10.5 — blast radius and rollback

| Step | Touches | Lost if wrong | Comes back from |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10.2 | `gradle.properties`, `build.gradle`, new test, `README.md` | nothing — jar name only | `git revert`; `master` is pushed and clean at `ec9b497f7` |
| 10.3 | same four files × 4 bands | nothing | per-band `git revert` |
| 10.4 | `release.yml` × 4 bands | **a release run could tag then fail to find its asset** | revert the file; the workflow already deletes its own tag on build/publish failure |

⚠️ **10.4 is the only step that can touch a published artifact.** The `--cleanup-tag` sweep deletes
releases by `mc<VER>-v*` prefix. ✅ **Resolved by keeping that prefix** (see 10.4a): the old
`mc1.21.*-v2.2.050-build.*` releases stay matched and get reaped on the next release, so there is no
orphaned-release cleanup. Had the tag been reshaped to `v<version>+mc<label>`, the sweep would have
stopped matching them silently — the release would have looked fine and the stale one would have
stayed up.

### 10.6 — open questions for the owner

1. **`2.2.050` vs `2.2.50`** (defect 3). Keep upstream's padding and accept that ModMenu disagrees
   with the filename, or normalise to `2.2.50` and have one number everywhere?
2. ~~**Old releases.**~~ ✅ **Retired by the 10.4a tag ruling** — the prefix is unchanged, so the
   existing `…-build.*` releases are reaped automatically. No manual cleanup.
3. **`master` publishes nothing.** Under R-g `master` has no workflow, so the **newest** band
   (`1.21.11`) has no release automation — its last tag, `mc1.21.11-v2.2.050-build.26`, predates
   R-g. Every older band still auto-releases. Out of scope here; flagged because it defeats the
   point of coherent upload naming for the one band players are most likely to want.

### What I am NOT doing

- **No per-version duplicate jars.** Ruled out with the owner: CurseForge attaches one file to many
  game versions, so byte-identical copies would be dead weight. The band range in the filename is
  the whole fix.
- **Not deriving `depends.minecraft` from the new property.** Tempting single-source-of-truth, but it
  needs `fabric.mod.json` templating through `processResources` and would change what the loader
  reads. The 10.2c guard makes the two representations *provably* agree, which buys the same safety
  without touching mod metadata.
- **Not restoring `.github/` on `master`** (that is R-g, and reopening it is an owner ruling).
- **Not touching `mod_version` itself**, pending 10.6.1.
- **No Modrinth/CurseForge publish automation.** Not asked for.

## The ship gate — run per band, before every push

Nothing enforces this list any more (R-g retired CI). **It is a person running seven commands.**

1. `./gradlew build` exit 0 — suite green, and the **count should match `master`** (~1705). A lower
   count means something was disabled to get there.
2. `python scripts/mixin-allow-audit.py --mc <version> --check` — 61/61. A `MISMATCH` is a fact to
   record, not a bug to suppress.
3. `scripts/boot-check.sh <jar> <version>` — 0 ERROR, 0 mixin failures, canary rejected.
4. `python scripts/config-id-audit.py --check` — 0 dead-everywhere. ⚠️ **Unavailable below `1.21.4`
   until 8.4 lands.**
5. `scripts/brew-smoke.sh` — passes **with** its vanilla control failing.
6. `scripts/gameplay-smoke.sh` — 29/29, and `GAMEPLAY_SMOKE_CONTROL=1` must **fail**.
7. `python scripts/drift-audit.py --self-test` **then** `--master master` — **0 MISSING on every
   band**. ⚠️ It audits `origin/master`, so **push first, then audit**.

⚠️⚠️ **`drift-audit.py` does not track a `scripts/`-only commit**, and tooling is exactly what a new
band needs to run its own gates. **Cherry-pick tooling to each new band deliberately**, or the band
silently cannot probe itself.

## Risk register

| # | Risk | State |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | Band count makes "all versions" unviable | ✅ **CLOSED** — 7 bands total, 4 branches left to cut |
| R2 | CI time explodes | **Downgraded** — branches build independently. Trigger: ~30 min per band |
| R3 | Version-specific code leaks into skill logic | ✅ **CLOSED** — 26 → 0 leak sites; `PlatformBoundaryGuardTest` held on two real API breaks |
| R4 | Silent mixin misbinding via dropped `@Slice` | ✅ **CLOSED** — `allow = N` on all 61 injectors, measured from bytecode |
| R5 | Item-ID drift silently disables config rows | ⚠️ **PARTIAL** — `config-id-audit.py` + per-band test, but **blind below `1.21.4`**. See 8.4 |
| R6 | Component-API cliff needs reimplementation | 🔴 **NOW IN SCOPE under R-l.** Confined to band `1.21.1`; it is what R-m decides |
| R7 | Live playtest disrupted | ✅ Phase 0 tag + instance backup |
| **R8** | **A fix lands on `master` and is silently never back-ported** | 🔴 **REOPENED.** Closed on three legs; two were removed in one working tree by R-g. Detection is now *"somebody remembers to run the script"*. **Each new band multiplies this** — 4 bands today, 8 after Phase 9 |
| **R9** | **`drift-audit.py` is blind to docs drift** | 🔴 **OPEN.** It classifies a `README.md`/`wiki/`-only commit as not-propagatable and ignores it — its own self-test asserts that deliberately. R-j made docs part of what every band ships, so a forgotten docs fix now serves a wrong page to that band's players. Interim check: `git diff --name-only master <band> -- README.md wiki/` must print nothing |
| **R10** | **Two branches resolving to the same `minecraft_version`** | **Dormant, not fixed.** The tag-reaping sweep that made it fatal was `release.yml`'s, gone from `master` under R-g — but the three bands still carry it. Keep the one-band-one-version rule |

## Standing rules that keep biting

- **Fixes land on `master` FIRST**, always. A fix authored directly on a band branch is a defect.
  Every band-propagation commit carries `Backport-of: <sha>`; a `master` commit that must not
  propagate says `Backport-not-needed: <reason>` **in the commit that made the decision**.
- **Never pin a comment to the build's Minecraft version.** A dated observation (*"removed in
  1.21.11"*) stays true; a claim about what this build targets goes false silently on the next cut.
  Four have already rotted, one of them cited as the *reason* for absent code (GitHub #7).
- **Never resolve a band difference by changing `minecraft_version` on `master`.**
- **A guard that has never failed is not known to work.** Every script here carries a `--self-test`
  or a control run, and refuses to report until it passes — because *"found nothing"* and *"there is
  nothing to find"* render identically.
- **Caveat-expiry pass** on every docs change: grep the **symptom**, not the file you edited. One
  wiki serves all four bands, so *"X works in \<version\>"* reads as *"X works for you"* three bands
  down.

---

## Deferred (explicitly out of scope)

- **NeoForge / Forge.** Blocked on `platform/` being real interfaces — today `PlatformPlayer`,
  `PlatformBlock`, `PlatformItem` and 7 others are `public final class` importing `net.minecraft`
  directly. A final class cannot have a second platform implementation. Never caught because
  Mockito 5's inline mock maker mocks final classes happily.
- **Versions below `1.21`.** Not requested.
- **Snapshot targets** (`26.3-snapshot-*`). Revisit once `26.3` is stable.
- **Test-suite split by cost** (old Phase 4.4). Trigger: any band's build exceeding ~30 min.
- **Trophy Hunter gameplay proof.** Wiring-proven on `mc/1.21.8` and `mc/1.21.5` but not
  gameplay-proven — it is rank-gated and the smoke player is Hunter 0. First thing to add if
  `gameplay-smoke.sh` is extended.
